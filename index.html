  <h1>Introduction to GitHub</h1>
  <p>
    This is the repository for web development environment class at Vanier College. 
    Creating this repository on May 30, 2023. We will all add our HTML pages to this repository and then merge the branches that we create with the main branch.
  </p>
  <p>
    GitHub allows developers to create repositories, which are like project folders that store all the files, code,
    documentation, and other resources related to a project. Users can clone repositories to their local machines, make
    changes, and push those changes back to the remote repository on GitHub. This makes it easy for multiple developers
    to work on the same project simultaneously and keep track of their changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    GitHub also provides features like pull requests, which allow developers to propose changes to a project and have
    those changes reviewed by others before merging them into the main codebase. It also offers issue tracking, where
    users can report bugs or suggest new features, and a wiki system for documenting projects.
